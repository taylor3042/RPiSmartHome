Here we have all the docs that I have refered to on this project mainly for the commands and the TCP/IP connections.

- Kaleidescape is the media server.

- Lutron is the lighting system.

- SSC-0012 is the IP controlled relay for the painting that hides the TV and the mechanisme that hides the projector (No doc available for this device, I just SSH-connected to it, typed "?" and a list of commands showed).

- Kramer VHS88 is the video switch.
